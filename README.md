DIP Task 01: Color Image Processing

Description

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates fundamental color image processing techniques. The task involves loading a colored image, performing color space conversions, channel separation, and binary image generation.

Features

· BGR to RGB color space conversion
· RGB channel separation (Red, Green, Blue)
· Grayscale conversion
· Binary image generation using fixed thresholding
· Visualization of all intermediate results

Technologies

· Python 3
· OpenCV
· Matplotlib

Usage

1. Install dependencies: pip install opencv-python matplotlib jupyter
2. Run the notebook: jupyter notebook DIP_task_01.ipynb
3. Replace the sample image path with your own image if needed

Learning Outcomes

· Understanding color space transformations
· Channel separation and analysis
· Grayscale and binary image processing
· Comparative visualization of image processing steps

Ideal For
